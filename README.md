# daily-task-manger-back-end
Welcome to the daily task manager app! We wanted users to be able to add daily tasks for themselves and assign a due date of completion. We then wanted users to be able to mark each task as either complete or incomplete. The app also includes a login/register form.

This is the backend repository.

Check out the frontend repository [here](https://github.com/serenalin121/daily-task-manager-front-end).

> Here are our models including field names and their datatypes:
```
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
	email: {
         type: String, 
         required: true
  },
	password: {
         type: String, 
         required: true
  },
});


const taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
	name: {
        type: String, 
        required: true
  },
     dueDate: {
         type: String, 
          required: true
  },
	completion: {
         type:Boolean, 
         default: false
  },
});
```

Here are our user stories:

As a user, I want to be able to login into my task manager app, add tasks to my app, edit/update my tasks in my app, delete my tasks in my app, assign a due date to my task, and mark a task as complete/incomplete in my app.


We hope our app will help you reach your goals every day!
